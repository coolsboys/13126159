How to handle loops in CFT:
First testing the inner CFG or loop in isolation, and then treating it as a node when testing the outer loop.

basic concepts:

Two kinds of basic program statements:
---Assignment statements(Ex.x=2*y;)
---Conditional statements(Ex.if(),for(),while(),...)

Control flow
---Successive execution of program statements is viewed as flow of control.
---Conditional statements alter the default flow

Program path
---A program path is sequence of statements from entry to exit
---There can be a large number of paths in a program
---There os an(input,expected output)pair for each path
---Executing a path requires invoking the program unit with the right test input
---Pths are chosen by using the concepts of path selection criteria

Tools:Automatically generate test inputs from program paths.
